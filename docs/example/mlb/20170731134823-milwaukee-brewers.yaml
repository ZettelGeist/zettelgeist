summary: Milwaukee Brewers
note: The Milwaukee Brewers are an American professional baseball team and are based
  in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The team is named for the city's association with the brewing
  industry.[1] Since 2001, the Brewers have played their home games at Miller Park,
  which has a seating capacity of 41,900.  The team was founded in 1969 as the Seattle
  Pilots, an expansion team of the American League (AL), in Seattle, Washington. The
  Pilots played their home games at Sick's Stadium. After only one season, the team
  relocated to Milwaukee, becoming known as the Brewers and playing their home games
  at Milwaukee County Stadium. In 1998, the Brewers joined the National League. They
  are the only franchise to play in four divisions since the advent of divisional
  play in Major League Baseball in 1969.
