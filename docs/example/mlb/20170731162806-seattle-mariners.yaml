summary: Seattle Mariners
note: The Seattle Mariners is an American professional baseball team based in Seattle,
  Washington. The Mariners compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club
  of the American League (AL) West Division. The team joined the AL as an expansion
  team in 1977. Since July 1999, the Mariners' home ballpark has been Safeco Field,
  located in the SoDo neighborhood of Seattle.  The 'Mariners' name originates from
  the prominence of marine culture in the city of Seattle. They are nicknamed the
  M's, a title featured in their primary logo from 1987 to 1992. They adopted their
  current team colors - Navy blue, northwest green (teal), and silver - prior to the
  1993 season, after having been royal blue and gold since the team's inception.[1]
  Their mascot is the Mariner Moose.
