summary: New York Yankees
note: The New York Yankees are an American professional baseball team based in the
  New York City borough of the Bronx. The Yankees compete in Major League Baseball
  (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division. They are one of
  two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the New York Mets
  of the National League. In the 1901 season, the club began play in the AL as the
  Baltimore Orioles (no relation to the modern Baltimore Orioles). Frank Farrell and
  Bill Devery purchased the franchise (which had ceased operations) and moved it to
  New York City, renaming the club the New York Highlanders.[1] The Highlanders were
  officially renamed the Yankees in 1913.
