summary: St. Louis Cardinals
note: The St. Louis Cardinals are an American professional baseball team based in
  St. Louis, Missouri. The Cardinals compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member
  club of the National League (NL) Central division. Busch Stadium has been their
  home ballpark since 2006. With origins as one of the early professional baseball
  clubs in St. Louis, entrepreneur Chris von der Ahe purchased a barnstorming club
  in 1881, then known as the Brown Stockings, and established them as charter members
  of the American Association (AA) the following season. Upon the discontinuation
  of the AA, St. Louis joined the NL in 1892; at that time, they were called the Browns
  and the Perfectos before they were officially renamed as the Cardinals in 1900.
  One of the most successful franchises in baseball history, the Cardinals have won
  11 World Series championships, the second-most in Major League Baseball and most
  in the National League. Their 19 National League pennants rank third in NL history.
  In addition, St. Louis has won 13 division titles in the East and Central divisions.
