summary: Chicago Cubs
note: "The Chicago Cubs are an American professional baseball team based in Chicago,\
  \ Illinois. The Cubs compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of\
  \ the National League (NL) Central division, where they are the defending World\
  \ Series champions. The team plays its home games at Wrigley Field, located on the\
  \ city's North Side. The Cubs are one of two major league teams in Chicago; the\
  \ other, the Chicago White Sox, is a member of the American League (AL) Central\
  \ division. The Cubs, first known as the White Stockings, was a founding member\
  \ of the NL in 1876, becoming the Chicago Cubs in 1903.[2] The Cubs have appeared\
  \ in a total of eleven World Series. The 1906 Cubs won 116 games, finishing 116\u2013\
  36 and posting a modern-era record winning percentage of .763, before losing the\
  \ World Series to the Chicago White Sox by four games to two. The Cubs won back-to-back\
  \ World Series championships in 1907 and 1908, becoming the first major league team\
  \ to play in three consecutive World Series, and the first to win it twice. Most\
  \ recently, the Cubs won the 2016 National League Championship Series and 2016 World\
  \ Series, which ended a 71-year National League pennant drought and a 108-year World\
  \ Series championship drought,"
